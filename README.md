# MoneyTracker
App to track expenses
Money Tracker is a simple, swift and powerful android application which can record and save the item's information with its cost and date of purchase in a secured database. 

The drop down menus also make adding items to the list very fast. Money Tracker is also capable of showing remaining balance/budget left after adding items to the list. Initial balance is Rs.2000 which can be changed anytime through drop down menu. 

I had great time making this app and learning many things about RDBMS and implementing it in android. I have tried to handle all possible errors. If you find any bug please send a mail.
